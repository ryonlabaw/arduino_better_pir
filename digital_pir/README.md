## Synopsis
Posting some promising results in the PIR area, of which most online discussions revolve around the same code + technique.

Example of how to read digital signals from PIR in a more stable format.
This method seems to work better than other methods and code samples available on the net.

Using simple timestamps and binary flags to track motion status.

## Code Example

See digital_pir.ino for arduino IDE example.

## Wiring Diagram

will be provided later
