## Arduino Better PIR

## ANALOG - Better PIR Values
Use the analog example to get reliable PIR motion readings.

- Faster than digital signals
- Reliable readings, less false alarms

## DIGITAL - Ok, but not as good as analog

The simple digital example shows how get better + more reliable readings using the normal OUT pin (digital signal) from a PIR sensor.

It utilizes timestamps to try to eliminate false alarms.
